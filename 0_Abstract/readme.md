# * Abstract

We devised and built a "smart detector" equipment that allows blind persons to walk freely with comfort. In this experiment, we used only one ultrasonic sensor as a simplified version. Two or three sensors can be employed for improved accuracy and assistance.
The major goal of this project is to assist blind persons in walking when their path is blocked by other items, people, or other similar obstacles. A buzzer is linked in the circuit as a warning signal, and the frequency of the beep changes depending on the distance of the object.
